Having lightning-fast online speed and refined browsers, designers rarely have to cope with any of the restrictions that formed the early days of the internet. A web page is, especially, a designer's canvas." </p><p>This may be true enough from the perception of someone already accustomed with the basics, but if phrases like "CSS responsive grid system" and "Google Web Fonts" are unusual to anyone, then jumping into the supposedly "oh-so-easy" realm of web design may still seem a daunting proposition. </p><p>In acknowledgment of this, we created a truly fundamental collection of web design basics having the rookie in mind. Of course, it's never a poor idea to review the basics, even though you consider yourself a wiz. </p><h2>1. Website Or Blog Design Basics - Grid Systems</h2><p>Since the development of codex during the 1st century, the grid has determined the way we read. Thousands of versions, involving many different arrangements of rows and columns, have come out over time. </p><p>Imagine the way text and images are actually set up in publications, newspapers and magazines. All these are the systems that were basically directly carried over onto the web, and they get the job done. Suggestion: numerous designers has tried to stay clear of the grid in the name of "creativity"; many such sites go unread. </p><p>In a world where consumers are as, if not more likely to explore the internet on smartphones and tablet computers rather than on traditional pcs, the concern of "responsive design "-- concepts that translate to more compact screen dimensions in an effortless and intentional manner-- is also extremely important. </p><p>Making our way of lives much easier, a substantial number of pre-fabricated grid systems have emerged which are responsive, compatible with primary coding languages, and typically free to obtain. </p><p>Several popular ones are 960. gs, Simple Grid and Golden Grid System, however the list of good alternatives is really large, with some being more complex than others. </p><p>Obviously, if you're feeling adventuresome or feel your project demands a really distinct remedy, then by all means, design your own. </p><h2>2. How Things Should Look </h2><p>We recently published a detailed blog on this subject, so we'll be short here. Generally, it's a known reality that in a large number of cultures, individuals read left-to-right and top-down. Even so, it is likewise a well-known fact that, inside of these parameters, reading tendencies follows a much more complex set of guidelines. This is especially true on the net where people actually "scan" pages a lot more than they "read" them.</p><p>Good web pages are developed in response to these particular measured reading trends by placing essential components, like the company logo, call to action or a key image, around the axes that the reader is anticipated to scan. These traditionally take either an "F" or a "Z" shape.</p><p>Beyond that, visual hierarchy is about signaling to readers what ought to be read first and exactly what should be checked out next. Right after page placement, this might involve methodologies such as font size, space, direction and font pairing, as well as the use of color highlights.<h2>3. Fonts that are Safe </h2><p>Now, the phrase "web-safe fonts" undoubtedly feels like a little something of an anachronism. But in the early days of the internet, browsers supported an incredibly limited number of fonts-- normally just ones which were already installed in end users' word processing software program-- if you deviated from these, some website visitors would just end up looking at arbitrary symbols. </p><p>These days, it is still correct that specific fonts are supported by almost all browsers while some other fonts are not, but the number of web-safe options has taken off thanks to the adoption of what is known as @font- face embedding in a large number of modern internet browsers. Indeed, many designers complain of having way too much to choose from. </p><p>Fee-based font services include Typekit, WebINK, Fontdeck and Fontspring. You can discover wonderful cost-free font styles, as well, if you do a little searching through totally free services like Google Web Fonts. Here is a recent roundup of nice free web fonts by CreativeBloq. </p><p>Now that you know where exactly to search, there are just a few general rules to consider: </p><p>Serif fonts are for headlines - In website design, serif fonts are always reserved for titles, because at smaller sizes they end up being hard to read. Body text should normally be sans-serif. </p><p>Keep fonts minimal - To minimize clutter, keep the number of various fonts on a web site to a minimum. Two or three at the very most. Look at our latest post on smart font pairing for more relevant information. </p><p>Never take up too much space - Always remember that some font files can be rather massive, and this can likely slow down the load time of an internet site. </p><h2>4. Color and Image Choices</h2><p>The principles of graphic and color placement are not especially unique to web site design, so we will not go into too much depth here. The main maxim to keep is: never overdo it. </p><p>For color options: </p><p>Always keep your color combination minimal - Just like fonts, simply just stick to 2 or 3. They should certainly resemble the host's branding, while serving to spotlight essential areas, as noted in the "visual hierarchy" segment. </p><p>Think about color blindness - Just one other consideration really worth keeping in the back of your thoughts is the reality that something like 5% of the (male) populace is colorblind, so watch with your color pairings. </p><p>For graphics: </p><p>Keep movement nominal - Refrain from images that move. Avoid the desire for flash. Even.gifs are very questionable, unless implemented with the highest skill. In general, studies reveal that visitors much favor sites that always keep still. </p><p>Choose graphics thoughtfully - Do not use images just as a means to fill space; visitors will pick up on this immediately and might lose interest in your web page. Rather, simply use images which communicate useful details-- illustrating accompanying content or detailing something about a product being explained. This article on Designinstruct covers this issue more in-depth. </p><p>Regularly acknowledge all stock image licensing constraints - Be aware of the licensing constraints related to your images. Some images are copyrighted, meaning that you or your client will need to pay to use them, according to your needs. </p><p>Keep file overall sizes small - Be sure your image sizes are as low as feasible (web resolution is 72 ppi). Images often account for 60% or more of a website page's size/loading time. </p><p>Author: Lisa Parziale<br />Portside Marketing, LLC<br />3102 Maple Ave, Dallas, TX 75201<br />https://www.portsidemarketing.com/website-design/<br />(214) 206-0575</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/PortsideMarketing">FACEBOOK</a> | <a href="https://plus.google.com/+Portsidemarketing">GOOGLE</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/PortsideMkt">TWITTER</a> | <a href="https://newswire.net/profile/LParziale">NEWSWIRE</a></p><h4>Thanks for Reading about our Website Design Basics</h4><br><br><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3353.7417541941345!2d-96.81009008488126!3d32.799106080965366!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x864e9933f0be922f%3A0x6b3d7803de1af11f!2sPortside+Marketing%2C+LLC!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1527614362252" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p><a href="https://portsidemkt.blob.core.windows.net/website-design-basics/Website-design-basics.html">Website design basics</a><br> <a href="https://portsidemkt.blob.core.windows.net/website-design-basics/Website-design-basics.html">web design basics</a><br> <a href="https://portsidemkt.blob.core.windows.net/website-design-basics/Website-design-basics.html">website design tips</a><br> <a href="https://portsidemkt.blob.core.windows.net/website-design-basics/Website-design-basics.html">web design tips</a><br> <a href="https://portsidemkt.blob.core.windows.net/website-design-basics/Website-design-basics.html">website design process</a><br> <a href="https://portsidemkt.blob.core.windows.net/website-design-basics/Website-design-basics.html">web design process</a><br> <a href="https://portsidemkt.blob.core.windows.net/website-design-basics/Website-design-basics.html">Design basics of the Dallas website</a><br> <a href="https://portsidemkt.blob.core.windows.net/website-design-basics/Website-design-basics.html">dallas fundamentals of web design</a><br> </p><br></body><br></html>
